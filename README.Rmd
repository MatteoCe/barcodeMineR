The goal of barcodeMineR is to facilitate the download of DNA sequences from the NCBI and BOLD repositories, 
taking advantage of the future asynchronous framework to speed the operations while respecting the API requests
limits. It outputs a [refdb](https://github.com/fkeck/refdb?tab=readme-ov-file#refdb-a-reference-database-manager-for-r) object.

## Installation

As the package is still in development, you can install this version of barcodeMineR,
directly from the GitHub repository, using the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/) package:

``` r
BiocManager::install("MatteoCe/barcodeMineR")
```

The installation might require the update of various packages, which may fail. It is not necessarily an issue, thus you may proceed nonetheless.

## Getting started

Take a look at the [barcodeMineR website](https://matteoce.github.io/barcodeMineR/) for more information!

## Issues and 'to dos'

* Remove field _lengthGene_? It might have no purpose, considering the sequence itself is in the refdb object and can be modified using the refdb package functions.

* Change default _api_rate_ in ncbi functions from 3 to 2.8, to slow down requests that might build up to 4 per seconds with slow internet connections.

* Change default _ask_ argument from TRUE to FALSE in both bold and ncbi functions?

* Add stringr code in taxonomy functions to search for both genus and species names in the output in order to get also those records identified as _genus_ cf. _species_, for example.
