The goal of barcodeMineR is to facilitate the download of DNA sequences
from the NCBI and BOLD repositories, taking advantage of the future
asynchronous framework to speed the operations while respecting the API
requests limits. It outputs a
[refdb](https://github.com/fkeck/refdb?tab=readme-ov-file#refdb-a-reference-database-manager-for-r)
object.

## Installation

As the package is still in development, you can install this version of
barcodeMineR using the
[remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes?tab=readme-ov-file#remotes)
package:

``` r
install_github("MatteoCe/barcodeMineR")
```

Following the installation, the package must be

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(barcodeMineR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
