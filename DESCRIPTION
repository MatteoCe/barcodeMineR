Description: A comprehensive and simplified tool to query multiple taxonomic 
    names on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the 
    Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) repositories, retrieving DNA sequences 
    and associated metadata for any wanted marker. It relies on 'bold' and 
    'rentrez', and takes advantage of the asynchronous framework from the
    'future' package to speed up the retrieval of data from the NCBI, while 
    respecting their API requests' rate limit. The final output is a 'tibble' 
    object, modified following the formatting requirements of the 'refdb' 
    package, including all CDS and/or r-RNA features as distinct 
    records with their corresponding sequence. Different quality control steps 
    are automatically performed to deal with commonly occurring issues that 
    derive from downloading and merging this type of data, including cleaning 
    of mining duplicates and standardization of the different formats of BOLD 
    and NCBI metadata (e.g. geographic coordinates, dates).
