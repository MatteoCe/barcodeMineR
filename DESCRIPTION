Description: This package allows to query multiple taxonomic names on the NCBI 
    and BOLD repositories and retrieve DNA barcodes and associated metadata for
    any wanted marker. It heavily relies on the bold and rentrez packages from 
    the rOpenSci, and takes advantages of the parallelizing framework from the
    future package to speed up the retrieval of data from the NCBI, respecting
    their API requests limit. The final output is a tibble object modified
    following the formatting requirements of the refdb package, and it is 
    cleaned from mining duplicates, differences in formats of BOLD and NCBI 
    metadata (e.g. geographic coordinates, dates) and commonly occurring issues
    that derive from downloading data from those repositories. In synthesis, it
    provides a unified framework for mining DNA Barcodes from the main 
    repositories, roviding clean, metadata-rich sequences in a programmatic way
    or interactively, depending on the wanted usage.
